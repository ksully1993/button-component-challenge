#Button Component Challenge - DevChallenges.io

Challenge: Create a reusable button with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states. You can work on the same project with other design system challenges. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue. Donâ€™t look at the existing solution. Fulfill user stories below:

    User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text
    User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
    User story: I can choose to disable the button
    User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
    User story: I can have different button sizes
    User story: I can have different colors
    User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
    User story: I can still access all button attributes
    User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough
